# Skills
I'm glad if these skills can be valued at somewhere ^^. <br>
** Note: All of my noticable skills, which are included in seperated categories below, are <i>ordered by my self-condidence decreasing, from left to right</i>. <br>

## Programming Languages 
C#, SQL, C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/ TypeScript, Python <br>
- *C#*: I started learning C# in 2021, in a very strange situation that I had had trouble building and running Java projects in Eclipse (when Java had been my main
programming language in my university). I found Visual Studio is a much, much better IDE, and fell in love with it, along with C# language; they supported and helped me gain self-confidence with my first ever software project in Windows Form. C# has been my main language since 2022. Of course, I'm still a "normal" student, so my love to VS and C#, of course, cannot hide the truth that I'm still lacking many aspects of C# programming, especially in my working field (ASP.NET Core). So I want to find a company where I can show my abilities, together with learning new knowledge and having much more experiences in my working path. <br>
- *SQL*: I learn much SQL knowledge by joining an internship of Bravo company. I didn't qualify to be an offical member of the company, but I have gained many interesting things that I'm currently using them for self-training and even my work as Backend Engineer.

## Frameworks and Libraries
ASP.NET Core, Bootstrap, JQuery, ReactJS

## Foreign Languages
Intermediate at English reading, basic to intermediate level at other English skills.
