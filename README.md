# About me
Hello, I'm Minh Tran Duc (you can call me "Koy"). Currently I'm a student in Hanoi University of Science and Technology (or HUST shortly). <br>
My main tech stack is ASP.NET Core, SQL Server (for backend). I'm still in my learning path for better frontend skill (I'm learning NextJS as well) <br>
If you want to have conversation with me, please contact me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/minh-tran-duc-364b55215/

# Skills
I'm glad if these skills can be valued at somewhere ^^. <br>
** Note: All of my noticable skills, which are included in seperated categories below, are <i>ordered by my self-condidence decreasing, from left to right</i>. <br>

## Programming Languages 
C#, SQL, C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/ TypeScript <br>
- *C#*: I started learning C# in 2021, in a very strange situation that I had had trouble building and running Java projects in Eclipse (when Java had been my main
programming language in my university). I found Visual Studio a much, much better IDE, and fell in love with it, along with C# language; they supported and helped me gain self-confidence with my first ever software project in Windows Form. C# has been my main language since 2022. Of course, I'm still a "normal" student, so my love to VS and C#, of course, cannot hide the truth that I'm still lacking many aspects of C# programming, especially in my working field (ASP.NET Core). So I want to find an environment where I can show my abilities, together with learning new knowledge and having much more experiences in my working path. <br>
- *SQL*: I learn much SQL knowledge by joining an internship of Bravo company. I didn't qualify to be an offical member of the company, but I have gained many interesting things that I'm currently using them for self-training and even my work as Backend Engineer.
- *C/C++*: My main language when I compete in Codeforce contests or solve Leetcode problems.
- *Java*: My first OOP language. If I didn't know Visual Studio, maybe Java would be my main programming language. But I think C# and Java are quite familiar, so changing from one to one is not a big problem. It just needs time, maybe not much. I hope that in one day I could make Spring Boot a master of mine.
- I have basic knowledge with HTML/CSS/JS stack, and can build a temporary frontend page which can be used for testing APIs. 

## Frameworks and Libraries
ASP.NET Core, Bootstrap, JQuery, ReactJS
* In projects, sometimes I used SignalR for realtime tasks.

## Foreign Languages
English - TOEIC 725 (02/2022)
